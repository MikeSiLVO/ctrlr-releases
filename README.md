# Ctrl+R

A modern desktop thin client for [rTorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent). Connects to your rTorrent instance over SSH, TCP/SCGI, or HTTP and provides a full-featured GUI for managing torrents.

## Download

**[Latest Release](https://github.com/MikeSiLVO/ctrlr-releases/releases/latest)**

| Platform | Installer |
|----------|-----------|
| Windows (x64) | `.exe` (NSIS) |
| macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel via Rosetta) | `.dmg` |
| Linux (x64) | `.deb` / `.AppImage` |

## Installation

### Windows

Run the `.exe` installer. Windows may show a SmartScreen warning since the app is unsigned — click **More info** then **Run anyway**.

### macOS

Open the `.dmg` and drag Ctrl+R to Applications. On first launch, right-click the app and select **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper (required for unsigned apps).

### Linux

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```sh
sudo dpkg -i ctrl-r_*.deb
```

**AppImage:**

```sh
chmod +x ctrl-r_*.AppImage
./ctrl-r_*.AppImage
```

## System Requirements

- Windows 10+ (x64)
- macOS 10.15+ (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Linux with WebKitGTK 4.1 (x64)
- A running rTorrent instance to connect to

## Getting Started

On first launch, Ctrl+R opens the Settings dialog to configure your connection. Create a profile with one of the supported connection types:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **SSH Tunnel** | Most common. Ctrl+R manages the tunnel automatically. |
| **TCP/SCGI** | Direct connection over LAN or a pre-established tunnel. |
| **HTTP** | Via an nginx `scgi_pass` proxy with optional Basic auth. |
| **XMLRPC** | XML-RPC endpoint (e.g., ruTorrent's RPC). |
| **Unix Socket** | rTorrent running on the same machine. |

Passwords are stored in your OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service) — never in config files.

> **Note:** When connecting over the internet with HTTP or XMLRPC, use HTTPS to avoid sending credentials in plain text. SSH tunnel connections are encrypted by default.

Every torrent that passes through Ctrl+R is logged to a local SQLite database with its `.torrent` file archived. Browse, search, and re-add or export torrents from the History dialog.
